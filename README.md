# TIC TAC TOE

In this project we build a Tic Tac Toe game app with Ruby. The game is played in the Terminal.

## Game Description

The Tic-tac-toe game is played by two people.
Up on starting, the players enter their names and each gets assigned a symbol.
The playground is a board consisting of a 3x3 grid with numbered cells

The players take turns to enter  a number corresponding to the cell they want
to mark. The goal is to mark three aligned cells with one's symbol. The alignment
can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal. The first player to achieve this goal is the 
winner. When none of the players is able to align his three marks. The game ends in a draw
